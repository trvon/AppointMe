# What is Does
The app streamlines the checkin process for appointments. using picture based security to authenticate users and bypassing secretarys entirely. Includes a online signup/checkin. And text message confirmations. ## How we built it We used android studio for the android app and for admin/secuity page we used a web based system using angular and node. We also used a ardinos bluetooth to check in based on proximity to the office.
